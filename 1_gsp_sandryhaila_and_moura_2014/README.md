## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd graph_ml
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Basic Usage

```python
from graph_signal_processing import GraphSignalProcessor, create_example_graphs
from pygsp import graphs
import numpy as np

# Create a sensor network graph
graph = graphs.Sensor(N=100, seed=42)
gsp = GraphSignalProcessor(graph)

# Generate a test signal
signal = np.random.randn(graph.N)

# Perform spectral analysis
analysis = gsp.spectral_analysis(signal)
print(f"Total energy: {analysis['total_energy']:.2f}")
print(f"Low frequency energy: {analysis['low_freq_energy_ratio']:.2%}")

# Apply graph filtering
low_pass_filter = gsp.design_graph_filter('low_pass', cutoff=0.3)
filtered_signal = gsp.filter_signal(signal, low_pass_filter)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Graph Fourier Transform
```python
# Forward GFT: fÃÇ = U^T * f
fourier_coeffs = self.eigenvectors.T @ signal

# Inverse GFT: f = U * fÃÇ
signal = self.eigenvectors @ fourier_coeffs
```

### Graph Filtering
```python
# Design filter in spectral domain
def filter_response(eigenvalues):
    return np.exp(-tau * eigenvalues)  # Heat kernel

# Apply filter: y = g(L) * x
filtered_signal = graph_filter.filter(signal)
```

### Anomaly Detection
```python
# Compute residual after low-pass filtering
smooth_signal = low_pass_filter.filter(signal)
residual = signal - smooth_signal

# Detect outliers based on residual magnitude
anomalies = np.abs(residual) > threshold * np.std(residual)
```
